         <h1> It blows my mind how people are so judgmental as to think that parents in old age home equals to terrible children.<br>

            Every time I see conflicts between parents and children and the parents wind up in old age homes, I refrain from judging the children right away. Because -<br>
            
            The relationship of parents and children is extremely unequal. Parents for a third of a person’s life, have incredible amount of power on it. What your life will turn out to be depends a lot, on your parents. Parents are the rule-makers of the relationship. In such a situation, if the children choose to abandon the parents, it is likely that the parents contributed to that, somehow. Therefore, every time I hear a sob story completely one sided from the parents’ point of view, I always take it with a pinch of salt.<br>
            Sometimes, there are no choices. Sometimes there are no children. Or the children are incapable of taking care of their own lives, leave alone that of their parents. Or the children need care themselves. I knew a man who was a complete alcoholic and needed constant care. His wife was overburdened with earning a living for her children and taking care of her alcoholic husband. I wouldn’t judge her for not taking care of his parents too.<br>
            Sometimes the parents have treated the people around them with abuse, contempt and a lot of disrespect. I can never know the exact extent or nature of the damage and therefore, I will not judge the situation.<br>
            And of course there are also the terrible children. I haven’t really come across any though. The situations I have seen, I thought the parents pretty much deserved it.<br>
            In India, Maintenance of and welfare of senior citizens and old parents Act puts the liability of maintenance of senior citizens on their children (men and women). This is because the state doesn’t have the infrastructure to take care of everyone.<br>
            
            Thus, by law, the parents are entitled to be maintained by the children. That however, doesn’t mean the same can’t be done by the children paying for old age homes.<br>
            
            So, also keep in mind that parents living in old age homes can be out of choice, with children paying for the same. So it isn’t always as one sided as children “sending” their parents to old age homes. Senior citizens can also choose it, in consultation with their children. I have personally seen many, in such a situation. </h1>
