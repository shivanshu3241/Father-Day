         <h1> Hey Dad!

            I know it hasn’t always been easy for you to be my father, but I also know you’ve always done, and always do, your very best.
            
            I think God put us in each others lives even before I was born. He knew I needed you long before I did. Maybe God knew you needed me too even before you did.
            
            If there was one sentence, word or expression I could scream that would let you know how lucky I am to call you “Dad,” I’d yell it with joy from the highest hilltop. I’d post it on the fridge, in the bathroom, on the front door, on your car mirror, on the back of your phone and maybe, just for fun, even by the toilet.
            
            You’ve helped me see who I want to be one day if I’m lucky and God continues to bless me.
            
            You’ve learned me patience, wisdom, and how to care for others. You’ve taught me a lot about caring for ourselves too, although I know there are still plenty of lessons to learn.
            
            I wish your father could be here with us to celebrate too. I bet he’d be so proud to see the dad you are to me.
            
            How fun it could be to laugh with him, have a meal together, watch the game, toss the ball around, and just hang with each other on our very special day!
            
            I wonder if he watches down on us and sees us even when we can’t see him? Do you think he does?
            
            I’ll be with you all day Sunday for our special day. It’ll be just you and me in the hospital room as much as the nurses and doctors will let us be. I know you still don’t open your eyes and can’t talk, but I’ve got plenty of thank you’s to say and lots of hugs to give.
            
            I love you dad. You’ve always been the best for me.<br> Your loved 'JANU' </h1>
