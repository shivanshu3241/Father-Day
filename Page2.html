         <h1> Daddy i still remembered that day on which i had an accident and i broke my hand and you were in the office and mom called the ambulance but due to traffic it was very late and you arranged all the needs you were so, paniced about it and at the operation time i still remembered that you was hiding that i was going to have an operation just because you was knowing that i would be tensed and when i acchived my 1st gold medal in swimming you were so proud of me and when i started my coding classes after few classes my teacher used to call you and give a feedback that how i am doing and whenever i used to ask you that what my teacher told you used to say that your teacher gave a negative feedback that you are not doing well. You said this just to make me encouraged but the truth was the feedback was always in a positive ways... Daddy i just want to say that because of you i am here at this level if you would not be there i would not be there "LOVE YOU MY SUPER HERO DAD" Happy father's day Daddy.... Daddy this is "NOT THE PIMPLE ONE, NOT THE DIMPLE ONE, JUST A SIMPLE GIFT FOR MY SUPPER HERO DAD"</h1>
